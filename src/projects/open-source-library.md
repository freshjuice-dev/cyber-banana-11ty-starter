A collection of accessible, customizable UI components built with modern web standards and zero runtime dependencies.

## Philosophy

This library was created with a few core principles:

1. **Accessibility first** - Every component is keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly
2. **Zero dependencies** - No runtime dependencies means smaller bundles and fewer security concerns
3. **Framework agnostic** - Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla HTML
4. **Customizable** - CSS custom properties for easy theming

## Components

The library includes essential components for building applications:

- **Buttons** - Primary, secondary, outline, and ghost variants
- **Forms** - Inputs, selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons
- **Feedback** - Alerts, toasts, and progress indicators
- **Navigation** - Tabs, breadcrumbs, and pagination
- **Overlay** - Modals, dropdowns, and tooltips

## Installation

```bash
npm install @username/ui-lib
```

```javascript
import { Button, Modal } from '@username/ui-lib';

// Use as Web Components
document.body.innerHTML = '<ui-button variant="primary">Click me</ui-button>';
```
