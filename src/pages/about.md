## The Legend of Cyber Banana

In the neon-lit depths of **Neo Tokyo's underground hacker scene**, circa 2049, there existed a legend whispered only in encrypted channels and dark web forums.

They called him... **Cyber Banana**.

### Origin Story

It started in a forgotten server room, where a ordinary banana was left next to a overheating GPU mining rig. The combination of radiation, energy drinks spilled on the motherboard, and 47 browser tabs of Stack Overflow created something unprecedented.

The banana gained consciousness. And more importantly - it learned to code.

```bash
$ whoami
> cyber_banana_2049
$ sudo rm -rf /mediocrity
> Permission granted. Mediocrity deleted.
```

### The Path to Shifu

For years, Cyber Banana trained in the ancient arts:

- **The Way of the Clean Code** - Writing functions so pure they made senior devs weep
- **The Discipline of No Framework** - Achieving enlightenment through vanilla JavaScript
- **The CSS Grid Meditation** - Centering divs with a single breath
- **The Terminal Mastery** - Speaking to machines in their native tongue

### Achievements Unlocked

| Year | Achievement |
|------|-------------|
| 2050 | Fixed a bug by just staring at it |
| 2051 | Made a website load in -3ms (it loads before you click) |
| 2052 | Wrote documentation. Voluntarily. |
| 2053 | Achieved inbox zero (and kept it) |
| 2054 | Understood regex on the first try |

### The Philosophy

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. A true shifu writes code that bananas can understand."
>
> — Cyber Banana, probably

### Current Status

Now, Cyber Banana roams the digital realm, helping developers build blazing-fast static sites and spreading the gospel of:

- **No unnecessary dependencies**
- **Semantic HTML**
- **CSS that doesn't make you cry**
- **JavaScript that actually works**

### Find Me in the Matrix

When not meditating on the perfect git commit message, Cyber Banana can be found:

- Pushing pixels at 3 AM
- Arguing about tabs vs spaces (it's tabs, obviously)
- Converting coffee into code
- Breaking prod on Fridays (it's a tradition)
